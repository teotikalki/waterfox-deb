  * Updated to Firefox 52.0.1
  * Fixed about home CSS
  * Fixed Netflix/Amazon Prime Video/Chase website issues by spoofing Firefox 38 user agent for those sites
  * Enabled various HTML5 features
  * Disabled browser updater completely, because updates for Waterfox are through apt repository, so we don't need that updater
